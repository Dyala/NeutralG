    <p><br>The Neutral Group worked with Atlantis management to define the organisational reporting boundary.  All direct and indirect carbon emission sources were mapped and classified under Scopes 1, 2 and 3 in line with the internationally-accepted Greenhouse Gas Protocol.</p>
    <p>Data on energy consumption, waste-to-landfill, laundry and fuel usage were converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) using relevant conversion factors and calculation methodologies sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), among others.</p>
    <p>The completed analysis revealed the various sources of CO2e emissions for Atlantis’ energy and environmental management efforts. A framework for setting and reviewing carbon emission reduction targets was developed and included in the final report.</p>
