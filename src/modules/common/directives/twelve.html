    <ul class="post-meta">
      <li>March 06, 2012</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates (6 March 2012)</strong>– In a highly successful 6 month pilot scheme, Atlantis, The Palm has proven the viability of converting its used cooking oil into biodiesel for its own use, and will now adopt this environmental initiative as a permanent strategy. Approximately 4,000 litres of waste oil from the resort’s 19 restaurants are converted to biodiesel each month. All of the biodiesel is used to generate extra electricity to run some of the resort’s operations.</p>
    <p>“Turning our waste products into renewable energy sources is a smart business practice and a key part of our environmental strategy,” commented Serge Zaalof, President/Managing Director, Atlantis, The Palm. He said the company decided on the initiative when Neutral Fuels opened the first biodiesel refinery in the Middle East.</p>
    <p>“This is 100% sustainable, hence our decision to make this a long-term commitment. We are proudly committed to conservation and aim to minimise the impact of our operations. From the Kerzner Marine Foundation that seeks to foster the preservation and enhancement of global marine ecosystems to embedding environmentally efficient
      practices in our day to day operations, we take a holistic approach. The partnership with Neutral Fuels has given us another innovative way to deliver on our responsibility.”</p>
      <p>Karl Feilder, CEO of NeutralvFuels, said the company had demonstrated countless times that a dedicated focusvon reducing carbon leads to operating cost reductions and improvements in the utilisation of assets. “These benefits have a positive effect on bottom line profit. Once they see the numbers, our clients immediately understand that it is entirely possible to be both environmentally and commercially viable.”</p>
      <p>Biodiesel made from used vegetable cooking oil is non-toxic, fully biodegradable, safer to store than fossil diesel and better for running diesel engines than fossil diesel. Tests show that running on 100% biodiesel reduces CO2 greenhouse gasses by about 50%, reduces smog-forming potential by approximately 50%, and eliminates 100% of sulphur emissions.</p>
      <p>Neutral Fuels is contributing towards an importantcenvironmental shift in the Middle East. Their focus is on business imperativescand the effect of biodiesel on the bottom line. They don’t talk green, theyctalk cost savings, better asset utilization and predictable fuel pricing, and this is what makes for a compelling business proposition.</p>
      <p>Neutral Fuels is re-writing the rules on biodiesel production, proving daily that higher quality, higher yielding biodiesel can be produced at a profit and without government subsidies.</p>

      <h2><a>McDonald’s UAE and Neutral Fuels Win Dubai Award for Sustainable Transport for Biodiesel Initiative</a></h2>
      <ul class="post-meta">
        <li>February 21, 2012</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>UAE, Dubai - 21 February 2012</strong>– Dubai Road and Transport Authority (RTA) has recognized McDonald’s UAE and Neutral Fuels for their commitment to sustainable transport by awarding them with a 2011 Dubai Award for Sustainable Transport (DAST), in the ‘Environmental Protection Category’. The award was presented by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai to representatives from McDonald’s UAE and Neutral Fuels for the recent biodiesel initiative, which saw McDonald’s convert its used vegetable cooking oil into biodiesel for its fleet of logistics trucks.</p>
      <p>The award highlights the vital role that McDonald’s UAE and Neutral Fuels have played in fostering and promoting sustainable transport systems in the Emirate, whilst supporting the RTA’s objectives of developing solutions, systems and practices of sustained transport.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s UAE launched its biodiesel initiative in July 2011, as the first ‘closed loop’ system which takes 100% of the used vegetable cooking oil from its restaurants to provide 100% biodiesel to 100% of the trucks. The initiative saw McDonald’s UAE partnering with Neutral Fuels, the first and only licensed biorefinery in the Middle East, to provide the efficient collection, recycling, and conversion of McDonald’s used cooking vegetable oil into biodiesel which the company then uses in its logistics fleet.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rafic Fakih, Managing Director and Partner of McDonald’s UAE commented “We are honoured to have been recognised by the RTA for our biodiesel initiative.  At McDonald’s UAE, we are constantly looking at ways to protect the environment and reduce our carbon footprint, and judging by the success of our biodiesel initiative, this is a step in the right direction. With this award, we hope to encourage other companies to continue to invest in sustainable transport initiatives in the future.”</p>
      <p>Karl Feilder, Chairman & CEO of Neutral Fuels comments, “McDonald’s is doing the right thing by contributing towards an important environmental shift in the Middle East. This initiative is tightly aligned with the ethical, environmental and economic values which form the core of their corporate sustainability strategy. Our highly efficient process, the first of its kind in the Middle East, has achieved worldwide recognition since its launch in 2011, differentiating Neutral Fuels from every other biorefinery and giving McDonald’s a significant economic advantage for their fuel related transportation costs.”</p>
      <p>Biodiesel is a cleaner alternative to other energy sources as it is made from organic sources such as vegetable oils and produces better environmental performance of diesel engines.</p>
