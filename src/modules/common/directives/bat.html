    <h4><span>Project Description</span></h4>
    <p><strong>warehousing managed by DHL - Energy monitoring and employee engagement</strong></p>
    <p>Provision of on-site electricity and gas consumption data with recording and analysis of temperature and humidity data in site warehousing led to a better strategy for controlling and operating site heating. This was implemented along with an employee engagement programme to manage energy usage better after new warehouse operations during a cold spell increased gas consumption hugely.</p>
